\section{Mission Statement}
The mission of this team is to implement software into the Moonrockers robot, both telelcommunications and autonomous. We plan to implement computer vision based algorithms to determine location based a image at a fixed point. From there, we will begin to implement the autonomy algorithms in which the robot will complete the tasks of our competition.
