\chapter{Development Environment}


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
There were no IDE's used for this project, we only used vim to do the file editing in ubuntu.

\section{Source  Control}
For this project, we used git via github for source control. We set it up on our ODroid and our PCDuino and have two repository's, one for telecommunication and one for autonomy. A developer connects to it by pulling down the repository and loggin in via their credentials that have access to the repository. 

\section{Dependencies}
\hspace{ 5mm}ROS Indigo


ODroid XU4 running Ubuntu 14.04

\section{Build  Environment}
There will be build scripts once we are in that stage of the project.
